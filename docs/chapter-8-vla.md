# Chapter 8: Vision-Language-Action VLA & Conversational Robotics

## What is VLA?
- VLA combines:
  - **Vision:** Robot sees objects  
  - **Language:** Robot understands spoken commands  
  - **Action:** Robot performs tasks  

Example: "Pick up the red box" → Robot sees box, plans action, picks it up

---

## Voice-to-Action
- Robots can use **OpenAI Whisper** or other tools to understand voice commands  
- Converts words into **robot actions**

---

## Cognitive Planning
- Robots use AI to **decide what to do step by step**  
- Example: Clean the room → Plan to pick objects, move them, put them away

---

## Multi-Modal Interaction
- Robot can use:
  - **Speech** → Talk to humans  
  - **Gesture** → Detect human movements  
  - **Vision** → See objects and obstacles  

---

## Capstone Idea
- Build a robot that:
  - Receives a voice command  
  - Plans a path  
  - Navigates obstacles  
  - Identifies an object  
  - Picks and places it  

---

## Summary
- VLA = see, understand, act  
- Voice-to-Action converts speech to tasks  
- Multi-modal interaction makes robots smarter
