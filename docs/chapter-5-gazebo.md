# Chapter 5: Simulation with Gazebo

## What is Gazebo?
Gazebo is software used to **simulate robots and environments**.  
It allows you to:
- Test robots without a real robot  
- Simulate physics like gravity, friction, and collisions  
- Test sensors like cameras and LiDAR  

---

## Why Simulation is Important
- Saves money (don’t need real robots)  
- Easy to test new ideas  
- Safe for experimenting  

---

## Physics in Gazebo
- **Gravity:** Robots fall if not balanced  
- **Collision:** Robots cannot pass through walls  
- **Friction:** Robots’ wheels or legs move realistically

## Simulating Sensors
- Cameras → Robot can “see”  
- LiDAR → Robot can “measure distance”  
- IMU → Robot knows its balance and orientation

## Summary
- Gazebo is a robot simulator  
- Simulates physics and sensors  
- Helps test robots safely before real deployment
