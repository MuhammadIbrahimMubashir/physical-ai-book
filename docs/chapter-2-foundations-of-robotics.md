# Chapter 2: Foundations of Robotics

## What is a Robot?
A robot is a machine that can do tasks automatically.  
It can be controlled by a computer or AI.

Examples of robots:
- Robotic arms in factories
- Drones
- Humanoid robots

## Parts of a Robot
1. **Actuators (Motors):** Make the robot move  
2. **Sensors:** Help the robot see, hear, or feel  
3. **Controller / Brain:** Decides what the robot should do  
4. **Power source:** Battery or electricity

## Degrees of Freedom (DoF)
- DoF is how many ways a robot can move  
- Example: A human arm has 7 DoF  
- More DoF → more flexible robot

## Kinematics (Simple)
- Kinematics means **how a robot moves**  
- Forward Kinematics → Where the robot’s hand goes if joints move  
- Inverse Kinematics → How to move joints to reach a point

## Summary
- A robot has sensors, motors, and a brain  
- Degrees of freedom define movement  
- Kinematics helps robots move accurately
