# Chapter 3: ROS 2 (Robot Nervous System)

## What is ROS 2?
ROS 2 stands for **Robot Operating System 2**.  
It is software that helps robots **control motors, read sensors, and think**.

Think of ROS 2 as the robot's **brain and nervous system**.

## Main Parts of ROS 2

1. **Nodes**
   - A node is a small program that does one task  
   - Example: One node controls motors, another node reads camera  

2. **Topics**
   - Topics are like **mailboxes**  
   - Nodes send and receive messages using topics  
   - Example: Camera node sends images to another node  

3. **Services**
   - Services are like **phone calls between nodes**  
   - One node asks another to do something and waits for a reply

## Why ROS 2 is Important
- Makes robot software organized  
- Easy to add new sensors or motors  
- Works for both simulated robots and real robots

## Python with ROS 2
- You can write ROS 2 nodes using **Python**  
- Python helps beginners write robot programs quickly

## Summary
- ROS 2 is the robot's brain  
- Nodes, topics, and services help robots communicate  
- Python can be used to control ROS 2
