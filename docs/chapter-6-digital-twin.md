# Chapter 6: Digital Twin & Unity

## What is a Digital Twin?
A Digital Twin is a **virtual copy of a real robot**.  
It behaves like the real robot in software, so you can:
- Test robot actions  
- Check sensors and movements  
- Fix problems without touching a real robot  

---

## Why Digital Twin is Important
- Saves money  
- Avoids damaging real robots  
- Makes testing faster and safer  

---

## Using Unity
- Unity is software to **create 3D worlds**  
- Lets you **see robots in realistic environments**  
- Helps test robot-human interactions

## Simulating Sensors in Unity
- Cameras → See virtual world  
- LiDAR → Measure distances  
- Physics → Test movement and collisions

## Summary
- Digital Twin = virtual copy of a robot  
- Unity = 3D visualization software  
- Helps test robots safely and efficiently
