# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI means making machines smart.  
AI allows computers to think, learn, and make decisions like humans.

Examples of AI:
- Chatbots (like ChatGPT)
- Recommendation systems
- Face recognition

These types of AI live only inside computers.

## What is Physical AI?
Physical AI is AI that works in the real world.  

Physical AI systems:
- Can move
- Can see
- Can hear
- Can touch objects
- Must follow physics laws like gravity and balance

Example:
A robot that can walk, see objects, and pick them up is using Physical AI.

## Digital AI vs Physical AI

| Digital AI | Physical AI |
|-----------|------------|
| Lives in computer | Lives in real world |
| No movement | Can move |
| No gravity | Must balance |
| Only software | Software + hardware |

## What is Embodied Intelligence?
Embodied intelligence means AI has a body.  

The AI:
- Thinks with a brain (AI models)
- Acts using a body (robot)
- Learns by interacting with the environment

Humans are the best example of embodied intelligence.

## Why Humanoid Robots?
Humanoid robots look and move like humans.  

Advantages:
- Can work in human spaces
- Can use tools made for humans
- Easier to train using human data

## Summary
- Physical AI connects AI with the real world
- Robots must understand physics
- Humanoid robots are designed for human environments
